## OS Project 1

Hello, here's that README file you asked for! I don't really know what you want me to put in here though. 

Lets see... documentation. There's not much to it, I left some comments in the code explaining things, and if you want to run the project you run "make run" to start it and then "make clean" to stop it.

It does run properly, tested it on the kent linux servers as you can see in the example output screenshot included.
